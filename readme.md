#   Language Model Trainer using ICT

Currently experimenting with Programmatic Prompting, and fine tuning language models using in context learning, with examples.
My goal is to recreate DSPY's implementation of their Optimizers - Bootstrap examples, fine which examples satisfy metric, generate more examples from that chosen sample and continue, until we satisfy metric accuracy requirement on test data.
Experimenting with DSPY to train a language model to be sarcastic and snarky with only 5-6 examples.
